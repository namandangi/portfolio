- Led a team of 10+ members to develop an infrastructure for supporting the clinical trial of a drug under approval from the FDA.
- Devised a mechanism for an eﬃcient application of image processing ﬁlters to gigapixel whole-slide-images, reducing the time required for ﬁltering by about 45% using CanvasAPI, Fabric.js, Paper.js, Flask, & OpenCV.
- Developed a pipeline to support the ingestion & processing of over 30,000 medical images directly over the web browser, where images ranged from a few MBs to several GBs (5GB+) in size using OpenSeaDragon, S3, EC2, Electron.js, & LibVips.
